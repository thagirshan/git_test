- I select a data set of the renewable energy generation world from 1960 to 2019. The Data set focused on renewable energy produced by every country. 
- The data set was easy to use but one thing i was looking for is not there. They list all the counties without the region. After seraing how i could convert the 
country to region. I found a form that talked about how you could use a data set which has a region and merged both data sets together. This will give mark the country to 
the right region.
- also i did do some change to focus on the latest year then all the year.
 There are few graphy i use to make view the data in a more visual way than number. use stacked bar graph and multiple line graph to see the growth of 
renewable energy from 1960 to 2019,
The last thing I was trying to do is to create a graph for users to interact. so they could compare different countries together to see which county is leading the 
renewable energy generation. I was able to create a function but could not get to the part where I could request the input form the user. 
I hope to go back to the project and make them more interactive.
